# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier

An **SMS Spam Classifier** project that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Naive Bayes** machine learning model to effectively detect spam messages. The classifier uses **NLTK** for text preprocessing and **scikit-learn** for model training, providing a simple yet robust solution for spam detection.

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes NLTK for stemming and stopword removal.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements the Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves reliable results in classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
